# AcousticSensingTutorial

This is a simulation tutorial for acoustic sensing using chirp signals.

The traditional_estimation folder implements the traditional approach (FFT) to estimate range, aoa, velocity.

The super_estimation folder implements the super-resolution approach (MUSIC) to esimate range, aoa, velocity.
